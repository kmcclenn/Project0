# Project0
My repository for Project 0.

This is my Project 0, and it is a fan website for the soccer team Chelsea FC. In the website, it describes recent news, standings, roster, trophies, and more about Chelsea. There are links to every other page at the top of each page.

### Home (index.html)
This page uses a Bootstrap alert component as well as its grid model to highlight some current news about Chelsea. It also has a form that asks your favorite player and some images. Even more, a @media query is used amongst all the titles of the pages to make it smaller when the window is smaller as to ensure that the photos don't wrap on to another line.

### Premier League Table (page2.html)
This shows the current Premier League table, highlighting Chelsea's standings as well as the relegation zone, Champions League zone, and Europa League zone. If you move your cursor over a select row, it highlights yellow.

### Current Roster (page3.html)
This shows Chelsea's roster for the 2019/20 season. It utilizes FlexBox as well as the Bootstrap Card component to give it a nice, adaptive look.

### Trophy Cabinet (page4.html)
This page has a list that shows all of Chelsea's trophies. It also uses Bootstrap's grid model to add a picture on the side.

### Other Information (page5.html)
